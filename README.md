# Project

## What to do

Your goal is to apply your understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms to a research problem of interest to you. Example types of applications are:
- Apply an algorithm (either learned in class or outside of class) to a problem of interest.
- Replicate an existing paper that uses reinforcement learning.


## What to submit

### 1. Project proposal

Sign-up for a 10-minute time slot to meet with Huy and discuss your proposed project. Meetings will occur during class time on Thursday, March 23.

**Due: 10am on Thursday, March 23**

### 2. Final code and results

Submit a GitHub repository to Gradescope that contains your code and a presentation documenting your problem, methods, and results. You will present your results in a 5-10 minute presentation during the last few classes of the semester.

Your code should include a clear main.py file that someone could run to replicate your results, as well as a file clarifying required packages (e.g., a Conda env.yml file or pip requirements.txt file).

Your presentation should mimic a short conference paper presentation.

**Due: 10am on Tuesday, May 2**
